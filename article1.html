        If you’re new to Formula One and fast cars fascinate you, we will bring you up to speed in this Beginners Guide to Formula 1. Formula One is an entrancing sport and it is quite easy to fall in love with it. As a beginner, you may feel a little bit like an outsider when other fans are discussing a driver, car, or race. That’s nothing to worry about. In this article, we will give you enough knowledge to set you on your way to becoming an F1 fan.
        Formula One is the fastest motorsport in the world, let us help you to find your feet in the F1 world with equal speed.
        So what is Formula One?
        Formula One (F1) is a series of races held at different venues around the world, of the fastest open-wheel, open-cabin, single-seated, four-wheeled autos in the world. There have been a few years when even six-wheeled cars participated in F1.
        The word ‘Formula’, included in the name, refers to a set of rules that the constructors of the car, its mechanics and the drivers have to strictly follow during the tenure that they are members of F1.
        When motor racing first began, there were no limitations on the power or the size of the cars. The races became unequal with cars with more power and bigger sizes easily outpacing the smaller cars. The races also created dangerous situations in which many participants got seriously hurt, some even fatally.

        <div class="a1text2">
        When racing resumed after World War II, the governing body of the sport, the FIA, introduced a set of rules that set limits on the size and the power of the cars. This created an even playing field for the participants and drivers, while more stress was laid on efficiency and design of the cars and also the capability of the drivers.
        The word ‘One’ comes from the grading FIA issues to the racing tracks, the approved cars and the drivers’ licences. The ‘One’ is also to distinguish F1 from street car racing and also to indicate that it is the ultimate in formula racing.
        Formula One is governed by the Federation Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) owned by the Formula One Group. The FIA, established on 20 June 1904, is a non-profit organisation and represents the interest of motoring organisations and motor car users.
        The organisation amends, alters and introduces rules to Formula One so as to ensure the safety of the participants in the races, promote fair play, and to ensure that the followers and spectators of Formula One get a good deal.

        Formula One is all about cars and every fan would like to know more about them. They are indeed a fascinating piece of machinery and a lot of effort goes into their construction. That is precisely why the Constructor’s Championship is awarded at the end of every racing season.
        Cars have evolved drastically over almost seventy years of Formula One. Today’s cars are much safer and more manoeuvrable. The dynamics have improved and electronics has crept in substantially over the years. Because of that, drivers have better control over the cars resulting in better speeds and fewer accidents. However, F1 cars still have open wheels and open cockpit and are single-seated.

        Formula One cars are aerodynamically designed to provide the least resistance as they cut through the air. The feature not only helps them attain great speeds but also to consume less fuel as well as to get a better grip on the tarmac.
        Because of their aerodynamic design Formula cars attain a speed greater than that of an airliner at take-off. But the wings and the diffusers of the car produce a negative lift or a downforce that presses the car down upon the track. Or else, drivers would have little control over the cars as cars would be air-borne over the track because of the air lift.
        A formula one car produces 5G of down force on an average. It means that 5 times the weight of the car is pressing down on the track This gives the tyres traction and prevents the car from skidding on bends and sharp corners. The down force also allows the drivers to take corners and bends at speed much higher than we could in our streetcars.

            Since 2014, all F1 cars have 1.6L, V6 turbocharged engines. To those uninitiated, the number after ‘V’ stands for the number of cylinders on the engine. The number before ‘L’ represents the displacement volume in litres of all the cylinders of the engine taken together.
            F1 cars are required to weigh a minimum of 746kgs without the driver and fuel in them. Constructors, along with the other members of the team including drivers, have to optimise the horsepower, torque and the fuel efficiency to suit their requirements. That is why F1 cars’ engines are fine-tuned for every F1 circuit.
            Revolutions per minute or revs as we call it, for F1 car engines are limited to 15000 rpm. F1 cars are capable of speeds of up to 375 (235 mph) kilometres per hour. Juan Pablo Montoya hit a top speed of 372.6 kph (231.523 mph) during the Italian Grand Prix in 2005 while driving a McLaren-Mercedes car.

            Tyres play a big part in Formula One races. Pirelli is officially recognised as the tyre supplier by FIA for Formula One. Unlike street car tyres, Formula One car tyres are built to last only between 60 to 120 kilometres (40 to 80 miles).
            Because one set of tyres will not last the distance of any F1 race, drivers have to make pit stops to replace tyres so that they can complete the races.

           Formula One car tyres are rated from C1 to C5 with C1 the hardest tyres and C5 the softest.
           Until the conclusion of the 2021 season F1 used 13 inch tyres, however, from 2022 they will move to 18 inch tyres as part of a raft of new technical regulations designed to make the racing more even.

           Participants in Formula One are not individuals but teams. You may not realise it, but each Formula One team employs hundreds of technicians, engineers and support staff. If you include the designers and the assembly employees, that number could well exceed one thousand.
           There are ten teams enrolled for the 2022 Formula One season with two cars each. According to the rules for the season, a maximum of 26 cars will be allowed to compete. That would mean a maximum of 13 teams because each team is allowed to field two cars.
           A formula One team comprises all the entities that design and produce the car and own the intellectual rights. Therefore if the chassis is designed by one company and the engine is supplied by another, the two taken together become the participating team. That is the reason you will hear names like Benetton-Ford or Williams-Renault.

          Formula One drivers are as fit as most athletes in any sport. They have very high stamina and extremely good reflexes. Driving a race is very demanding both physically and mentally. That is why drivers dedicate a lot of time both during the season and otherwise maintaining their physical health and well-being.
          All F1 drivers lose weight at the end of a race. That is because a lot of energy is spent by the drivers in working the brake and throttle pedals and concentrating on the track. Much energy is also spent when countering the G-force on the bends and sharp corners.
          G-force is the force an F1 driver experiences when he accelerates or the car is going around a bend or a corner on the track. F1 drivers will experience a force of 2G when accelerating and up to 6G on a sharp corner. It means that the drivers are pulled by a force equal to 6 times their weight.
          Although a drivers’ body is firmly strapped in his seat, their neck as well as their legs is free to move. Keeping legs and neck in position under these high g-forces takes a lot of strength and effort. That is why F1 drivers assign a high priority to strengthen their neck muscles for high endurance.

            A Formula One circuit is a loop of a road which is approved by the FIA as a race track fit for F1 racing. A circuit usually starts with a straight stretch and has several turns and corners. Most circuits run in a clockwise direction. Those few that are anticlockwise give drivers the most trouble because of G-force on their necks in a direction that they are used to.
            The average time taken for a race is 2 hours and the average distance of a circuit is 305 km (190 miles). But the distance varies in the length of the track from circuit to circuit as does the difficulty in negotiating the circuit. One round around a circuit is counted as one lap and races are usually specified as the number of laps of a particular circuit.
            Pit stops are essential for cars to change tyres and for making repairs, mechanical adjustments, refuelling or as a penalty. Refuelling is not allowed in F1 for now. However, drivers have to make at least one pit stop to change tyres because F1 tyres are designed to last much less than the distance of one race.
            Pits are located at the side of racing lanes and they are assigned in the order of qualifying rankings of the team. A pit may have even up to twenty mechanics who prepare for all eventualities one lap before the car makes a pit stop.
            Drivers make a call on taking a pit stop depending on the state of their tyres and any mechanical repairs or adjustments their car might need. The team leader in the pit will usually remind the driver that he has to make a pit stop one lap before a pre-scheduled stop. The less the number of pit stops drivers make, the more advantage they get in race times.

          A season of Formula One consists of a number of Grands Prix conducted over the course of a year. The F1 season usually starts in March and ends in December. There are 23 venues across the world where the Grands Prix are held.
          The 2022 FORMULA 1 calendar will feature a record 23 races, including a debut race at the new street circuit in Miami.
          Due to the ongoing pandemic, both the number of venues and the locations may change during the season. In 2020 for example, all the Grands Prix in the Americas were cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The cancellations were announced mid-F1 season.
          At the end of the F1 season, the World Drivers’ Championship and the Constructors’ Championship are awarded to the winners. The drivers’ championship is decided by the cumulative number of points the driver has accumulated in that season. The constructors’ championship goes to the team with the highest total of the points accumulated by both its drivers during the season.

          Why Should You Attend a Grand Prix?
          Each Grand Prix is held over three days, from Friday to Sunday, except in Monaco where the Friday practice sessions are held on a Thursday. The action starts on Fridays and culminates in the crowning event, the race on Sundays. Between Friday and Sunday, there are practice and qualifying sessions that set the scene for the race on Sunday.

          Practice sessions usually start on Fridays and last till Saturday mornings. If the races are scheduled to be held in the night, the timings of the practice sessions may vary. Practice sessions are for individual teams and their drivers to familiarise themselves with the track and fine-tune their cars.
          During practice sessions, the drivers will try out different types of tyres on the track to find out how long they last. They will also keep a close watch on their fuel consumption with different tyres and tune their engines accordingly.
          Drivers use the practise sessions to get a good feel of the track and the car. They will use this knowledge to get a good position in the qualifying rounds. Watching the practice sessions will let you identify the different cars and drivers during the race. It also gives you a chance to watch all the behind the scenes activities.

          Qualifying sessions are the most exciting experience you will get on a racing weekend. Generally held on Saturday afternoons, there are three qualifying phases Q1, Q2 and Q3. During qualifying sessions, drivers will push their machines to the brink in order to get a good position on the grid.
          In Q1, or the first qualifying round all the 20 cars (if there are 20 cars participating) will take part. The five cars finishing last will be eliminated from any further qualification sessions. They will take the grid positions from 16 to 20 depending on their timings in Q1.
          The remaining 15 cars will participate in the Q2 session. In this session a further five cars that finish last will be eliminated from the last qualifying session. They will take grid positions according to their performance in the Q2 session.
          Q3 is the last qualifying session and decides the grid position for the remaining 10 cars. In this session, drivers will really work their throttles during this session in a bid to win the pole position. The pole position is considered a distinct advantage. The polesitter gets an unencumbered track and clean air to take a lead which many times tends to be unassailable.
          That is why qualification sessions are considered to be the most exciting time of a racing weekend.

          After the grid is set in qualifying, barring any penalties either for wrongdoing or technical changes to the car, the grid will start how they ended qualifying.
          The cars come out early for an installation lap, then grid up, where they are assessed by the team, and the drivers have an anxious wait as the clock ticks down until the race begins. During this time some will be interviewed, some listen to music, and drivers like the affable Kimi Raikkonen avoid eye contact with anyone as they get into the zone.
          After a ‘parade lap’ of the drivers being driven around the track to wave to the crowd, they they fire up the cars and complete a warm up behind the safety car.
          At the completion of the warm up lap, the starter waits for the signal, then it’s lights out and away we go!
          The first corner is always a nerve-jangling time, more so for team bosses and those of us watching, than it is for the drivers.
          After a frantic opening lap, it is then time to settle down and race to the chequered flag.
