<strong>Introduction:</strong>
<br>
The essential story being told by my site is for new and and current Formula 1 fans to visit and gather new information
about their favourite teams as well as learning new things about the sport.
I implement a - structure
<br>
<br>
<strong>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</strong>
<br>
My love and enthusiasm for the sport
I have gained inspiration from the official Formula 1 website. Their aesthetic is neat and simplistic but at the same
time, the design was smooth making it easy to navigate around.
Inspiration to show others the path to learn more about the sport

<br>
<strong>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</strong>
<br>
My website has a simple and sleek design that accomodates people without any technical know-how can easily access the website.
I have also added hyperlinks to some parts of my article that redirect to external articles to facilitate learning to accomodate
the lack of specific information in my own website.
<br>
<br>
<strong>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</strong>
<br>
Readability: The use of a dark grey colour scheme. Takes inot account people with colour deficiency. Dark background
with light text makes it easier for people with colour blindness to rad the content. With the use of a colour blindness simulator,
I was able to deploy a color scheme suitable for this situiation. I used the colour code #212329 , source www.colorhexa.com/212329,
Navigation with the anchor text- The header remained the same throughout the site. This makes the suer easier to
navigate around he site and read all the articles in an efficient and click as least as possible.

<br>
<strong>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</strong>
<br>
One thing I had to learn or rather pay attention to, is the layout of news or blog websites.Most of these websites generally
have a similiar layout of text and images. The positioning of media such as pictures and videos was something I had to pay
particular attention to as well. Secondly,
<br>
<br>
<strong>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</strong>
<br>
I feel that the aesthetics of my site works very well with the overall theme. My site is also easy to access and navigation is
smooth as there are multiple ways of doing so and knowing which article you are on.
<br>
<br>
<strong>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</strong>
<br>
One aspect I would like to improve on is my organisation of code and the elimination of redundancies. I felt like
there were ways to shorten my code and prevent writing the same code, in my case some of the CSS styling of texts and images,
but I was not able to sort them out in a time efficient manner.
<br>
<br>
<strong>What resources were used when creating your work?</strong>
<br>
Use of W3 schools
