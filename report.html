Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure
did you choose to implement.
The essential story being told by my site is for new and and current Formula 1 fans to visit and gather new and upcoming information about thier favourite Teams.

State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include
guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.


State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.

State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.
Readability: The use of a dark grey colour scheme. Takes inot account people with colour deficiency. Drk background with light text
makes it easier for people with colpour blindness to rad the content. With the use of a colpur blindness simulaotr, I was able to
deploy a color scheme suitable for this situiation. the colour code #212329 , source www.colorhexa.com/212329,
Navigation with the anchor text- The header remained the same throughout the site. This makes the suer easier to
naviagte around he site and read all the articles in an efficient and click as least as possible.

State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe
how you did that (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any
changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).

What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?
I feel that the aesthetics of my site works very well with the overall theme

What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently
another time?
One aspect I would like to improve on is my organistion of code. I feel like there were ways to shorten my code and reduncies to
eliminate but I was not able to sort them ou in a time efficient manner.

What resources were used when creating your work? You should list here any sources of
information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should
also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.
