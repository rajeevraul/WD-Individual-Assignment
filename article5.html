       <h1 id="alfaromeo">Alfa Romeo</h1>
          <div class="articlealign">
            <div class="a5text1">
              Alfa Romeo announced earlier this month that it would be formally launching its car after the first three-day test at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, making it the last on the grid to hold an official unveiling.
              Drivers Valtteri Bottas and Guanyu Zhou took part in testing earlier this week using a black-and-white camouflage livery, but the final design for this year’s car has now been revealed.
              The team retains the traditional colours of the Alfa Romeo brand for this season, but has switched from a majority white livery to a chiefly red design.
              The majority of the nose, the bulkhead and the halo have all turned red on this year’s car, while the engine cover also turns red, with the addition of ‘Alfa Romeo’ written in an old-fashioned font.
              The livery was created by Alfa Rome’s Centro Stile design centre. According to the team, it is “a stunning yet subtle nod to the past, recalling historical designs of years past and the heritage of Alfa Romeo and Sauber Motorsport, in the Hinwil team’s 30th year in Formula 1.”
              “The start of the season is always an exciting time, one in which we see the fruit of the work of hundreds of people over a long period of time,” said team principal Frederic Vasseur.
              “The C42 is a car we look forward to seeing racing, not just because it is the first we built in this new regulations cycle, one in which racing should be closer and more thrilling, but because we have the utmost confidence in this car helping the team make a big step forward towards the front of the grid.”

          </div>
           <div class="a5text2">
              The official launch of the C42 car comes after a difficult outing for Alfa Romeo in Barcelona, where it slumped towards the rear of the mileage charts.
              The three days of running were interrupted by a number of issues, limiting the team to just 175 laps between Bottas, Zhou and reserve driver Robert Kubica. Only Haas completed fewer laps during the test.
              Bottas joined the team from Mercedes for the 2022 season, and said earlier this week that he was enjoying his early days with Alfa Romeo despite only managing 54 laps in the first test.
              “The size of the team is quite a bit smaller, but it’s not necessarily a bad thing, and at least so far I’ve been enjoying it,” Bottas said.
              “There are so many new people and new things to get used to and learn, and still I would say I am in the adaptation phase of actually getting properly to know the team and how everything works. But that’s part of learning.
              “I would say it’s been a pretty quick process getting used to it. But there are good vibes. I’ve been really, really enjoying it, and with a bit more track time, I would be even happier, but at least it’s been fun.”
              The Alfa Romeo C42 will make its next on-track appearance in the second pre-season test, which takes place in Bahrain from 10-12 March, before the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix on 20 March.

                 AlphaTauri have delivered a Valentine's Day treat with the first images of their sleek new car for the 2022 Formula 1 season.
                 Revealing a revised blue and white livery as they kickstarted their campaign with a digital launch and video, AlphaTauri will hope the AT03 builds on a very promising 2021 this year, the first of the sport's new era.
                 Red Bull's sister team have retained Pierre Gasly and Yuki Tsunoda for 2022's rules revolution, which has mandated the new-look cars we have seen this launch season.
                 AlphaTauri, who were formerly known as Toro Rosso before a name change in 2020 to push the Red Bull-owned fashion brand, finished sixth in the championship last season, although their car - particularly in the hands of Gasly - was regularly a top-10 contender.
                 "This year sees a huge change to the car as, due to the new regulations, the look and design is completely different, so the team has had to start from a clean sheet of paper," said Gasly.
                 "We won't know the true performance of the AT03 until we get it out on track at pre-season testing in Barcelona but so far, I think it looks great and I am very excited to get this new season started."
                 Team boss Franz Tost added: "I am excited to finally reveal what our 2022 Formula 1 car will look like.
                 "It is a completely new era for F1 and we hope that this package will be very strong, following last year's success.
                 "Once again, we have worked closely with AlphaTauri to launch our new car and I think we've managed to deliver something very special."
                 AlphaTauri are the fifth team to provide a glimpse of their look for 2022, although so far Aston Martin and McLaren have revealed their "real" cars with a physical launch. AlphaTauri are one of many teams who are set to reveal their cars for the first time in the flesh before pre-season testing begins on February 23.

                    Alpine are penultimate team to launch their car, with A522 revealed two days before first pre-season test; Blue and pink livery due to new title sponsor in BWT, while car will be predominantly pink for opening two raceshave revealed a striking new livery on their 2022 Formula 1 car and a unique colour 'flip' plan for the opening races, as the French team look to make a big leap up the order in their second campaign.
                    The main A522 look is predominantly blue but also has large splashes of pink as Alpine, formerly known as Renault, celebrate a new title sponsor in BWT, who previously brought their colours to the Aston Martin team.
                    In an added twist, it was revealed during Alpine's launch that the colour scheme will 'flip' for the first two races of the season, meaning a dominant-pink look for the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian GPs.
                    Launched two days before the season starts in earnest with winter testing, Alpine are the ninth team to formally unveil their new challenger, designed to the new regulations aimed at revolutionising wheel-to-wheel racing.
                    They say the car unveiled in Paris was a show car, with the team to shakedown their 'real' challenger in Barcelona on Tuesday before the winter test
                    Alpine finished fifth in the constructors' standings last year, their first following Renault's rebrand, with that result largely down to an unlikely race win for Esteban Ocon in Hungary.
                    Ocon is again joined by two-time world champion Fernando Alonso this season, with the Spaniard - who joined the team

                  last season and impressed - openly admitting that the team's success in maximising the new rules is what he's back in F1 for.
                  "I came back because of this regulation," said Alonso. "I think the team did an amazing job, so we are all very motivated."
                  The changes in F1 aren't the only big ones Alpine are contending with in 2022, as they have also made significant alterations behind the scenes.
                  Otmar Szafnauer, formerly of Aston Martin, is in as team principal - with Marcin Budkowski leaving his role - while another experienced F1 technical chief Pat Fry is in at Alpine as chief technical officer.
                  "I look forward to helping them beat not just the Aston Martins of this world but everybody else on track," said Szafnauer, with Aston Martin likely to be one of Alpine's main rivals.
                  Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said last week that he is "not discounting any teams" from running at the front this year, and Alpine will hope to make the most of the rules reset and challenge closer to the front than last year.
                  Alpine's launch means nine of the 10 cars have been launched, while even Alfa Romeo - whose official reveal date is on Sunday and after pre-season testing - have completed a shakedown in their car.
                  Most teams have also been on track with their new challengers, giving a first glimpse of the new-look cars in action.
                  Alpine's shakedown is the day after their launch on Tuesday, less than 24 hours before the first winter test begins in Barcelona.
                  There are three days of action at the Circuit de Catalunya from Wednesday morning until Friday evening, and with so many changes it provides crucial running and data for the teams, while fans will also get a look of a potential new pecking order for the sport.

                        Aston Martin have unveiled the car they hope will propel them further up Formula 1's pecking order in 2022, as the iconic British manufacturer bids to take advantage of the sport's huge rules reset.
                        The team launched their new challenger, the AMR22, at Aston Martin's Gaydon base, with both Sebastian Vettel and Lance Stroll present to reveal a classic, but updated, racing green livery on a new-look 2022 car.
                        The car also features splashes of lime green, replacing the pink from last year.
                        Aston Martin are the third team to kick-off their season with a launch but their car is believed to be the closest so far to being the finished product.
                        They will also complete a shakedown at Silverstone on Friday, giving fans a first glimpse of F1's new cars, which have been built to the technical regulations aimed at improving wheel-to-wheel racing and overtaking.
                        After finishing a disappointing seventh last year, their first season back in F1 following a 60-year absence, Aston Martin will be desperate for their AMR22 to compete further towards the front.
                        Vettel, the four-time world champion, will once again be partnered with Stroll, whose father Lawrence owns the team.
                        But Aston Martin have undergone big changes behind the scenes over the winter, with long-serving team boss Otmar Szafnauer having left, replaced by former BMW and Porsche man Mike Krack.
                        "We are continuing our journey to the summit of Formula 1," said team owner Lawrence Stroll.
                        "And we want to win.

                     But we know that winning isn't easy, and that's why we have a five-year plan to keep climbing and to get to the top."
                     Vettel added: "Look at that car, who wouldn't feel excited about the prospect of racing that?
                     "And when it comes to hopes for the season, I do not think anyone really knows what to expect.
                     "There are new rules and of course all the teams will be hoping that they have got it right. Everyone wants to win, me included, and no one would be in Formula 1 if their dream was not to win. I am no different.
                     "The main thing is to keep moving forward and moving up. This is only year two of a five-year plan, so we are still quite near the start. But this team has big ambitions and big plans, and I am hugely excited to be a part of that.

                   <h1 id="ferrari">Ferrari</h1>

                        <div class="a5text1">
                          Ferrari have unveiled the car they hope will return Formula 1's most famous name to the front of the grid in 2022.
                          Without a championship in 14 years and on one of the longest droughts of their illustrious history, Ferrari are aiming to capitalise on the the clean slate of F1's rules revolution to challenge for wins and titles again this season.
                          They will do so in a fierce-looking F1-75 car, which has a darker red and black livery - a nod to the Scuderia's oldest cars combining with the innovative design of these new F1 machines.
                          Carlos Sainz called the car "aggressive, radical and beautiful", while team-mate Charles Leclerc admitted: "Expectations are very, very high."
                          "I'd like the F1-75 to be up for the fight on track at every grand prix to go toe-to-toe with our rivals," added team boss Mattia Binotto.
                          While Ferrari are the sport's most successful and iconic team, in recent years they have dropped from perennial title challengers to midfield runners. But optimism comes from the team having improved significantly last year - finishing third behind Mercedes and Red Bull standings - and the fact they have long-been concentrating on acing the new rules.
                          The regulations have been overhauled in a bid to improve wheel-to-wheel racing and Grand Prix excitement, and Ferrari - with more resources than most - will hope the reset plays into their hands.
                          Revealed at Maranello, the F1-75 takes its name from an important anniversary for the Prancing Horse, marking 75 years since founder Enzo Ferrari produced his first Ferrari car.

                        What are Ferrari's targets in 'innovative' new car?
                        Ferrari have described their new car as "daring and innovative" - and the car is a departure from the previous looks we have seen this season. While it comes with risks of failure, Ferrari hope thinking outside the box can pay off.
                        "It was at first for us important for us to be fully open minded in the way we approach the exercise," explained Binotto. "It was not a matter simply continuing the concept of the previous car and adapting them to the new rules.
                        "It has been aerodynamic-driven, and all the mechanical concepts have been a consequence of it. We tried all the directions and we picked the one we thought was the best for the final performance. I think there is a lot of non conventional choices. It is a big innovation for us in terms of the design."
                        Ferrari rebounded from their worst season in 40 years to finish third last year. Although the team acknowledge that is still below expectations.
                        "Expectations are high because we are Ferrari," said Leclerc. "We are a team that is expected to win all the time.
                        "What makes me confident about this year's car is the work that I've seen in the last few months. That's been absolutely incredible by the whole team. It's been a long time we've been working on this car now and I can see how well we've been working so that gives me the confidence for the future.
                        "But it's never easy to know until you are on track at the first qualifying year. But the feeling is good, everyone is extremely motivated and I'm also extremely motivated to be back in the car and to finally drive this beautiful car."
                        Sainz added: "Our target is to be back up there fighting for wins.
                        "Obviously we have very tough competitors in F1, Mercedes, Red Bull, McLaren, even Alpine and Aston Martin could be up there this year. The target of Ferrari is always to be back being competitive."
                        Binotto also knows just how important acing this rules refresh is for the Scuderia.
                        "If we do not win, is that a failure for Ferrari?" he stated. "I think it's important for Ferrari to be back to being competitive and we've said for a long time that 2022 is out best opportunity for that.

                             Haas become the first team to reveal images of the 2022 car ahead of physical reveal at first pre-season test; Team stick to white-based livery from last year but big changes to car clear to see; New rules focused on improving racing with overhauled aerodynamics
                             Haas have provided a first look at the all-new Formula 1 cars by unveiling their livery for the 2022 season, as the sport prepares for a shake-up amid the dramatic regulation changes.
                             The new F1 rules - introduced to help closer, more competitive and exciting racing - have been described as the biggest technical overhaul in 40 years, and Haas became the first team to release images of a 2022 design on Friday.
                             While not a physical reveal, with the American team's challenger expected to look different when it hits the track, the renders do highlight the aesthetic changes and the overhauled aerodynamics, with a new floor, wings and 18-inch tyres the big changes.
                             Haas are set for an official unveiling of their car before the first morning of pre-season testing, just as they have done since joining the grid in 2016.
                             They have an unchanged driver line-up for this year, retaining Mick Schumacher - son of F1 legend Michael - and Nikita Mazepin, who joined the team as rookies last season.
                             Haas kick off F1 launches with 'dramatically different' look
                             The new rules offer all teams a clean slate to redesign their cars and reshape their fortunes, and Haas in particular will be looking to take advantage of that opportunity.

                           The team suffered their worst F1 season last year, finishing 10th and last in the standings and failing to score a single point in a car that was barely upgraded from 2020.
                           Haas have, however, been openly targeting 2022 and optimism will come from that focus.
                           The VF22 is the first entry to emerge from the team's all-new design-office in Maranello, Italy - led by technical director Simone Resta, on secondment from Ferrari, who described the new car as the "most complex project".
                           They say that while the design is "dramatically different, the livery of the new entry is a evolution of last year".
                           "It's that time of year where you're naturally optimistic that the hard work and effort of everyone will translate to a competitive entry on track," said the team's owner, Gene Haas. "We made the decision back in 2020 to really channel time and resources into the VF-22, foregoing anything track-related for 2021 - which wasn't easy to watch.
                           "Hopefully that decision bears fruit and we return to challenging for points and taking something from the weekends."
                           Team principal Gunther Steiner added: "Last season was a long one but I'm confident that 2022 will see us back in the mix with the VF-22."
                           Some of the aerodynamic details of the Haas car have been removed, which will likely be common in this F1 launch season as teams bid to keep most of their ideas secret until the last possible moment.

                              McLaren launch Formula 1 2022 car with 'aggressive' new look and hopes of acing rules reset
                              McLaren become fourth team to kickstart their season with a launch; MCL36 features an updated colour scheme, with team hoping the car - which will be driven by Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo - further closes the gap to the front amid F1's new rule
                              McLaren have launched their car for the 2022 season, revealing a bold and "aggressive" updated livery as the Formula 1 giants bid for a fast start to the sport's new era.
                              Having returned to race-winning ways for the first time since 2012 last year, a revitalised McLaren hope their MCL36 gives drivers Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo the chance to consistently fight towards the front.
                              Taking the wraps off at their Technology Centre base, the team unveiled a new design - due to F1's regulations overhaul - and a new colour scheme on the car they insist is "real" and ready for pre-season testing.
                              The MCL36 look has taken inspiration from McLaren's retro Gulf Oil livery from Monaco last year, combining 'Fluro Papaya' with a lighter blue. It was described as "aggressive" by young British star Norris.
                              "We wanted something that was very vibrant," added McLaren CEO Zak Brown.
                              "The livery changes we did last year - both in Monaco and in Abu Dhabi - we got a lot of great fan reaction and they like to see a lot of energy.
                              "I think it's got speed and elegance to it that we thought would go on top of the fast race car that hopefully we've designed this year."

                            McLaren's MCL36 launch was part of an impressive three-car live reveal as the iconic British outfit also launched their IndyCar and Extreme E - which they are debuting in this year - challengers, as well as their Esports livery.
                            They say their common colour schemes are 'galvanising the McLaren Racing family'.
                            "This is a first for us as a team, and in the wider world of motorsport," said Brown
                            Can McLaren fight for victories in 2022?
                            While McLaren finished fourth behind Ferrari in F1 last year - following an impressive third in 2020 - their season included a race win, a one-two and their highest points finish since 2012.
                            Still undergoing infrastructure upgrades, with a new wind tunnel and simulator in the pipeline, they say their aim for a first title since Lewis Hamilton's in 2008 is a long-term goal - acknowledging their current competitive disadvantages compared to the top teams.
                            Sky F1's Ted Kravitz explains the new rules and regulations for 2022 with most teams launching their cars this week ahead of the new Formula One season.
                            The sport's 20-time world champions are, however, cautiously confident about their latest car, mandated by the sweeping new rules aimed at improving wheel-to-wheel racing.
                            "With a blank sheet of paper, the team here at McLaren have been working hard to establish a competitive platform for this and future seasons," said technical director James Key.
                            McLaren driver Lando Norris says he has been very impressed with the new MCL36 car, insisting it looks fast and he can't wait to get out to test it.
                            "However, we know we've only just begun to unlock performance from this regulation set, and that one of the key features of the 2022 season will be the intense development war as teams assess each other's designs and innovate new ways of generating downforce through ground-effect."
                            As well as a strong leadership team, led by Brown, team principal Andreas Seidl and Key, McLaren also possess one of F1's most talented and popular driver line-ups in Norris, who recently gave the team a welcome boost with a new four-year contract, and Ricciardo, the now eight-time F1 race winner.
                            "Last year was my best in Formula 1 so far, and I'm really proud of what I achieved as a driver, and what we achieved as a team," said Norris, 22.
                            "But I know the best is yet to come, and my aim is to carry the positive momentum we built up over the last year and take that with me into this exciting new era of Formula 1.
                            "There's always a nervous excitement around the start of the new season, but that's turned up to 11 when you enter a new era of regulations," stated Ricciardo, formerly Max Verstappen's team-mate at Red Bull.
                            "Heading into my second year with McLaren feels great and I feel like we learned a lot as a team in 2021, which will help us as we take on this new challenge."
                            McLaren will hit the track with their new car in a filming day before the first pre-season test in Barcelona on February 23-25. The season starts, following another three-day test in March, with the Bahrain GP on March 20.

                                 Mercedes have revealed the new-look car they hope will leave the controversy of Abu Dhabi behind and continue a record-breaking F1 title streak, with Lewis Hamilton confirming he is racing in 2022 after a "difficult time".
                                 Launching their W13 a day after the FIA made the first changes from their inquiry into last season's Abu Dhabi decider with Michael Masi removed as race director, Mercedes have pledged to "move on" from the dramatic events that saw Hamilton cruelly beaten by Max Verstappen to the championship.
                                 Hamilton was alongside his new British team-mate George Russell, 13 years his junior, as Mercedes unveiled their new car and new colours.
                                 Returning to tradition after two years in a black livery, the Silver Arrows are back in silver and teal with a dash of red for 2022, with the revolutionary new rules giving them a fresh challenge in their bid to continue their unprecedented streak of eight constructors' titles.
                                 They completed a Silverstone shakedown later on Friday in the car although, due to the adverse weather, significant running was impossible. Hamilton's presence at the launch marked his first media interview since leaving the paddock dejected on December 12, and amid a period of silence there were fears a "disillusioned" seven-time world champion would quit the sport.
                                 "I never ever said I was going to stop," insisted Hamilton, 37, on Friday. "I love doing what I do and it is such a privilege working with this large group of people. There's no feeling quite like it.

                               "It was obviously a difficult time for me. It was when I needed to take a step back, focus on being present, so I had my family all around me and creating great moments.
                               Lewis Hamilton says it was a 'difficult time' and that he needed to step back after the season finale in Abu Dhabi.
                               "It eventually got to the point where I would be attacking again coming into another season. It is exciting seeing George coming in and seeing his energy."
                               Hamilton, who with Russell forms the first British F1 driver line-up since him and Jenson Button at McLaren 10 years ago, said Mercedes have the "ultimate goal of the world championship, raising the bar and doing something no one has ever done before”.
                               Their goal remains unchanged from a 2014-21 hybrid era they dominated, although the completely new rules aimed at improving wheel-to-wheel overtaking and competitiveness through the field presents a challenge.
                               "The hopes are we have a competitive car," explained Mercedes boss Toto Wolff. "It's not a given with the new regulations. We say we want to win another title, but we don't even know if we're going to be in the hunt for a new title.
                               "What I know with this team is that we've always been able, even when circumstances are difficult like the beginning of last season, to dig ourselves out of disadvantageous situations."
                               Hamilton returns alongside new recruit Russell
                               Mercedes became the eighth team to officially reveal their car for F1's all-new era on Friday, and it came just a day after the FIA confirmed Masi would be replaced as race director as part of sweeping structural changes.
                               Toto Wolff says it was good for Lewis Hamilton to take a break from social media to 'comprehend, digest and overcome' after the disappointment of the 2021 season closer in Abu Dhabi.
                               But while Wolff praised the "right steps" and said "it's very encouraging to see that action has been taken", he insisted Masi's removal was not the reason for Hamilton's return in 2022 - while also stressing that he was never concerned his star driver was going to leave.
                               "I think that adversity has always made him stronger, more resilient and determined," said Wolff. "This is the attitude I feel in him right now and the mindset I see in the team."
                               Last year was only the second time Hamilton had not won a drivers' title since 2014, and in devastating and controversial circumstances.
                               He comes into the season with renewed energy and with only his third team-mate at Mercedes, with Russell having replaced Valtteri Bottas after six seasons. Russell, a graduate from the Mercedes driver line-up, has starred at Williams in his first three seasons in the sport.
                               "It doesn't change me," said Hamilton. "I think it's always a positive when you have new blood and new energy.
                               "George has had an amazing career so far, in getting to Formula 1 and what he's done within Formula 1. It's going to be exciting to see him grow and work with him.
                               "I've had him sitting behind me before when we were working away, getting the set up on the race weekend and now I'll be working opposite from him, collaborating with him and hopefully steering the car in the same direction. I'm excited for that."
                               Russell said becoming Hamilton's team-mate was "surreal".
                               "Lewis was a superhero to me. You see these incredible people and you don't think they're human.
                               "Now, growing up and having the opportunity to race alongside Lewis is a real privilege for me because I've got such a great opportunity to learn and see how the best do it. "
                               The huge rules overhaul has the potential to reset the field and although Mercedes - given their previous success - go into the season as favourites, they really have no idea where there work behind the scenes will put them.
                               "It does [feel as exciting as ever]," said Hamilton. "It just takes you back to being a kid. With this new era of car, we've never seen such a drastic change.
                               "It's such a huge change in so many ways that it's been really interesting seeing the designers and everyone coming together to find the best way of creating a masterpiece.
                               "We have no idea how it's going to end; we have driven laps on the simulator but [it's] making sure that we get the right correlation."
                               Hamilton and Russell, weather permitting, are due to drive the car at Silverstone today.
                               The car is back in silver this year after two years in black, a change implemented to promote diversity in F1.
                               "While the black livery reverts to predominantly silver for 2022, the roots of our mission to become a more diverse team have been firmly planted and will continue to bear fruit in the years to come," say the team, who have an 'Accelerate 25' programme to become a more diverse and inclusive team.
                               Wolff added: "The black livery was a clear intent and a clear demonstration of our mission to become a more diverse and inclusive team. It has become part of our DNA, but the silver colour of the Silver Arrows is as much our DNA, it's our history.

                                    Red Bull have revealed their new car and new team name for 2022 as they look to remain at Formula 1's summit, with Max Verstappen bidding to retain his crown in the first year of the sport's all-new era.
                                    The new RB18, while sporting the normal Red Bull livery, is another dramatic departure from the look of 2021, built to the sport's sweeping new rules as F1 bids to improve wheel-to-wheel racing.
                                    F1's new drivers' champion Verstappen, as well as team-mate Sergio Perez and team boss Christian Horner, were all present at the launch, where Red Bull also confirmed a new title sponsor in American tech firm Oracle.
                                    The team will now be known as Oracle Red Bull Racing, and Sky Sports understands the deal is one of the biggest in F1 history, worth £100m a year over five seasons.
                                    The car is the second to be unveiled this year after Haas but Red Bull provided a first look at a 2022 machine in the flesh. Horner did, however, stress: "By the time we get to the first race the car will not look very much like this.
                                    "And I think the evolution will be very quick as we progress through the season."
                                    Will Red Bull, Verstappen build on 2021 glory?
                                    Their new challenger certainly has a lot to live up to.
                                    Last year, a resurgent Red Bull were title challengers for the first time since their four straight championships from 2010 to 2013.
                                    While they were pipped in the team standings by F1's next dominant force Mercedes, the sport does have a new drivers' champion in Verstappen, who edged out Lewis Hamilton in a thrilling, yet hugely-controversial, decider.
                                 </div>
                                 <div class="article5pic">

                                  Verstappen will be sporting the No 1 on his car this year - he is the first title-winner to elect for that privilege since Red Bull's previous champion, Sebastian Vettel in 2014.
                                  "We're aiming to build on what we achieved last year, which is to retain the title," said Horner.
                                  "The big unknown is have we missed something in these regulations, has another team stolen a march because they've focused on it since 2021?
                                  "We believe we've got a good car. The RB18 is coming alive."
                                  It is not just a new era for F1 this year, but also Red Bull due to their new title sponsor and the fact their previous engine suppliers Honda have left the sport.
                                  After a new agreement, Red Bull are using the same Power Units as before while, looking to the long-term future, the team have set up their own powertrains division to build engines themselves.
                                  F1's new rules have been introduced in a bid to improve racing but also competitiveness, meaning the likes of Red Bull and rivals Mercedes will likely be looking over their shoulders come the start of a new season as, with a fresh slate, more teams have been given a better chance of racing at the front.
                                  But Red Bull evidently believe they can fight for, and win, an F1 title again.
                                  "A lot is unknown about the car," said Verstappen.
                                  "What is important is to prepare yourself in the best way possible physically, but in terms of the car you don't know. I am very curious to see how the car goes on track."
                                  The first pre-season test begins on February 23-25, while the first race of the season is on March 20 in Bahrain.
                                  What are the changes for F1 2022?
                                  The rule changes, which have been long in the making and were initially planned for 2021 before being delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, mean we have a completely new generation of cars.
                                  The concept is, in essence, a simplified yet striking new-look race car following a drastic aerodynamics overhaul.
                                  The key changes are:
                                  A ground-effect floor. The 2022 car has two long underfloor tunnels which create a 'ground effect' - meaning there is more suction under the car to pull it to the tarmac, while also ensuring more of the downforce is generated from under the car. The concept was popular back in the 1970s and '80s in F1.
                                  A simplified front wing and a sharp new rear wing. These not only look great, but the completely new parts on the 2022 cars have been designed to stop sending airflow outwards, narrowing it instead. The curved rear wing still has DRS, although it may be less impactful.
                                  18-inch tyres with wheel winglets. Another throwback addition, the bigger tyres are aesthetically pleasing while they should also improve the handling of the cars. The winglets have been added to help direct air away from the rear wing.
                                  What will the changes do?
                                  The new cars do not just look a lot different, but they should have a marked effect on the on-track product, with more exciting and competitive wheel-to-wheel racing the expectation.
                                  They are designed with a focus on shifting the aerodynamic focus from the wings to underneath the car, making it easier to follow the car in front, and thus improve racing.
                                  F1's estimations are that the 2021 cars lost 35 per cent of their downforce within three car lengths of the car in front and almost 50 per cent in a single car length. You may have heard the words 'dirty air'.
                                  The new cars? They claim to drop those numbers to just four and 18 per cent respectively.
                                  "They're relying a lot more on air passing underneath the car very quickly which sucks the car down onto the ground, and gives what we like to call ground effect," said Sky F1's Ted Kravitz.
                                  "You've created a vacuum," added Anthony Davidson. "There's suction to the ground, and you're relying less on the wings to give you rear grip, and more on the floor."

                                       Williams have hit the track in their new Formula 1 2022 car, giving the FW44 its maiden run and fans a look at their 'real' design.
                                       At their official launch, Williams only revealed their new livery on a show car - much like Red Bull did last week - although later on Tuesday, Nicholas Latifi drove a much different-looking machine at a sodden Silverstone.
                                       They are the second team to shakedown their new car, after Aston Martin. Williams, one of F1's most famous and historic manufacturers, are looking to maximise the much-changed rules to leap up the order this year after an improved eighth-placed finish in 2021, and start the new season with a new driver in Alex Albon after George Russell's move to Mercedes.
                                       Albon and team-mate Latifi were both present as the sport's 16-time world champions became the sixth team to launch their season, with an updated blue colour scheme kicking off a new F1 era with a nod to their past.
                                       The car has different shades of blue in a diamond design, as well as dashes of red to highlight their British history.
                                       The FW44, as always, takes the initials of their legendary founder Sir Frank Williams. "If it's as fast as it looks, that will be very, very good," said team boss Jost Capito. The team added that it 'embodies the exciting new era of the Williams brand, whilst still retaining the classic team spirit'
                                       After three seasons at the bottom of F1 standings in 10th - during which they scored a combined eight points - Williams rebounded back to eighth last year.

                                     Their final tally of 23 points was aided immensely by back-to-back double points finishes in Hungary and Belgium, and it was in Spa where they scored their first podium in six years as Russell was classified as second in a Grand Prix that was abandoned due to the rain.
                                     With Russell replacing Valtteri Bottas after three years at Williams to join Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes, Albon steps into his shoes and will be expected to lead the team into a new era.
                                     Albon has two F1 seasons under his belt, one and a half of which alongside Max Verstappen at Red Bull, scoring two podiums before he was axed in favour of Sergio Perez at the end of the 2020 season.
                                     "We don't have many days before our first race and so we quickly need to understand which areas of the car are strong and where we need to make improvements," said Albon, whose team-mate Latifi has scored seven points in two seasons.
                                     "I'm sure it will be a little bit of a learning curve as we all try to learn how to get the most out of the new regulations, but the objectives and the way that we focus on this car is very much the same as in previous years."
                                     Williams will hope their Mercedes-powered FW44 gives them a better chance of consistently fighting for the top-10, let alone making it through Q1 in qualifying.
                                     The first three-day pre-season test starts on February 23 in Barcelona, before another in Bahrain on March 10. The season then gets underway with the Bahrain GP on March 20.
